# Traditional Signature Based Antivirus Evasion Tests

## Purpose
PoC tool to help change text strings in a source file (e.g. executable) based on LeetSpeek or letter case.

## Advice
This is a PoC tool created for educational purposes only. If you use it illegally and end up in jail or frying your hard disk, don't blame the author. I also know that may programming skills sack, that's why I am not a software developer. Feel free to modify the code anyway your like.
